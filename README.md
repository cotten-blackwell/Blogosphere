# Blogosphere
iPhone app for browsing blog posts

As another one of my self-training projects, the Blogosphere app demonstrates my mastery of one of the most common and important needs when creating an app: downloading data from the Internet and displaying it in a list. It is also an investigation of: 1) the Model-View-Controller design pattern (MVC) that is essential for all iPhone apps; 2) how to parse and use information in JSON format; 3) how to use the built-in UITableViewController to display a list of blog post titles and thumbnails; and 4) how to display a webpage inside an app using a WebView.
